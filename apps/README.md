There are a few changes I would make to the code. 
1) I would like for all the imports of features that are created like the types, shortenurl, lookupurl to be in one file, so we do not have to make multiple files to keep track. 
2) The second thing I would have done here is organize the code better and do a better job of seperating it. 
3) There are some functions that appear to have the same/similar prupose and coule be simplified and I think that is another major change I would make to the code.
